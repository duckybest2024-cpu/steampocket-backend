/**
 * In-progress multi-step rounds (Mines, Blackjack) live here rather than in the database —
 * they're ephemeral, single-player, and resolved within seconds to minutes. Persisting every
 * intermediate "revealed tile" or "hit" would bloat the ledger for no benefit; only the final,
 * settled outcome becomes a `Bet` row. One active round per (game, user) at a time, which
 * mirrors how every real casino UI works — you can't open two mines boards simultaneously.
 *
 * NOTE: this is a single-process store. A horizontally-scaled deployment would swap this for
 * Redis with the same key shape (`${game}:${userId}`) without touching call sites.
